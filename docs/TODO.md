# To Do

## Batched printing

Some way to add multiple lists together and print them all at once. This would reduce wastage from leaders for example.

## Issues

- Inverse labels that aren't 45x100mm print incorrectly (Inverse generation uses a fixed size invert object)
- No way to remove empty rows
- Generate enough leaders to fill a row
